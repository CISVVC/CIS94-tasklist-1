# CIS94-tasklist-1

For this project, add a function called *display_tasks* that will take an array
of tasks as a parameter and will display them when the page **index.php** is accessed by the web browser.  
Call the function fromin the file **index.php** in this project repository, it is already provided.  

Hint, look at the function **display_csv_file** in the file
called **task_functions.php**, the function that you will write will be called *display_tasks*.  It is very 
similar to the display_csv_file function except that the $tasks array has already been provided.
