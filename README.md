# CIS94-tasklist-1

For this project, add a function called display tasks that will take an array
of tasks and will display them on the page index.php.  Call the function in the file
index.php in this project repository.  Hint, look at the function display_csv_file in the file
called task_functions.php, the function that you will write should be called display_tasks.  It is very 
similar to the display_csv_file function except that the $tasks array has already been provided.
